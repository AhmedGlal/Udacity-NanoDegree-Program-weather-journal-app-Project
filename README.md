# Weather-Journal App Project
> By Ahmed Mahmoud Mohamed Glal  From Scratch

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Steps
#### step1:
* in the first, i creat Weather HTML Page.
* then, i add CSS to HTML.
* to see how it looks and make changes on it to test css .
* then, i add JavaScript to HTML.

#### step2:
1. create file called tests.js To test running server.
2. create file called server.js To running server side.
3. then , Add Node.js Packages (express, cors, body-parser) to server.js.
4. then , Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
4. then , create file called app.js To running client side Based on Udacity starter code from animal examble.
